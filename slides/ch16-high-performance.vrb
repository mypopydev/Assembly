\frametitle {Reduce dependencies to allow super-scalar execution}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Use different registers to try to reduce dependencies
        \item The CPU has multiple computational units in 1 core
        \item You can benefit from out-of-order execution
        \item You can get more out of pipelines
        \item You can keep more computational units busy
    \end{itemize}
