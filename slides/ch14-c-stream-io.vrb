    \begin{itemize}
        \item The {\tt FILE} object has a buffer and may
              contain data which has not been written
        \item Failure to close with {\tt fclose} could result in lost data
        \item The system will close the underlying file, but will not
              call {\tt fclose} automatically when your process ends
    \end{itemize}
